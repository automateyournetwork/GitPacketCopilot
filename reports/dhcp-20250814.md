# Packet Analysis Report: dhcp.pcap

## Executive Summary
This report details the analysis of a packet capture file, `dhcp.pcap`, containing two partial DHCP address negotiation sequences. A client device was observed attempting to obtain an IP address from a DHCP server. The capture shows the initial discovery and offer stages, but the negotiation process does not complete in either instance.

## Key Findings
- Two distinct DHCP Discover/Offer transactions were recorded.
- The same client (MAC: 00:0b:82:01:fc:42, Grandstream Networks, Inc.) initiated both requests.
- The client sent two DHCP Discover packets in quick succession, approximately 70ms apart.
- A single DHCP server (IP: 192.168.0.1, MAC: 00:08:74:ad:f1:9b, Dell Inc.) responded to both requests.
- The server offered the same IP address, 192.168.0.10, in both transactions.
- The DHCP exchanges are incomplete. The subsequent DHCP Request (from client) and DHCP ACK (from server) packets are missing from the capture.

## Conversations & Flows

**Transaction 1**
1.  **DHCP Discover:** The client (00:0b:82:01:fc:42) sends a broadcast message to discover a DHCP server.
2.  **DHCP Offer:** The server (192.168.0.1) responds, offering the IP address 192.168.0.10 to the client.

**Transaction 2**
1.  **DHCP Discover:** Approximately 70ms later, the same client (00:0b:82:01:fc:42) sends a second broadcast message.
2.  **DHCP Offer:** The server (192.168.0.1) responds again with the same IP address offer of 192.168.0.10.

## Performance & Timing Analysis
- The server's response time is very fast, at less than 1ms for both transactions.
- There are no signs of packet loss, high latency, or other network errors within the captured traffic.
- The client's behavior of sending a second Discover request after only 70ms is unusual and may indicate a client-side issue.

## Application & Protocol Insights (TLS, DNS, HTTP)
This capture contains only DHCP protocol traffic. No other application protocols such as TLS, DNS, or HTTP were observed.

## Security Observations
No security threats or anomalies were detected in this capture. The traffic appears to be legitimate, albeit incomplete, DHCP negotiation attempts.

## Recommendations
- **Perform a longer capture:** A more extended packet capture is necessary to determine if the client eventually completes the DHCP (DORA) exchange or if the process consistently fails.
- **Investigate the client device:** Check the configuration and logs of the client device (Grandstream Networks, Inc.) to understand why it is sending repeated Discover requests without proceeding to the Request stage.
- **Check server logs:** Review the DHCP server logs for any entries corresponding to the client's MAC address (00:0b:82:01:fc:42) to look for potential errors or configuration issues.
