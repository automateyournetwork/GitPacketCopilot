# Packet Analysis Report: capture.pcap

## Executive Summary

This report details the analysis of the `capture.pcap` file. The capture contains a single UDP packet originating from a private IP address (`192.168.2.61`) and destined for a public IP address (`170.72.169.30`) on the non-standard port `9000`. Due to the limited scope of the capture (a single packet), a full analysis of network performance, application behavior, or security posture is not possible. The primary purpose of this report is to document the observed traffic and provide recommendations for further investigation.

## Key Findings

- **Single UDP Packet:** The entire capture consists of one UDP frame.
- **Connectionless Protocol:** The use of UDP indicates a connectionless communication, often used for real-time applications where speed is prioritized over reliability.
- **Outbound Traffic Flow:** Traffic originates from a client on a private LAN and is routed through a local gateway to a public internet destination.
- **Non-Standard Port:** The destination port `9000` is not associated with a common, well-known service, suggesting it may be used by a custom application, development server, or peer-to-peer software.

## Conversations & Flows

The capture contains a single, one-way communication flow.

*   **Source Host:**
    *   **IP Address:** `192.168.2.61` (Private)
    *   **MAC Address:** `c8:e2:65:48:73:b2` (Intel Corporate)
    *   **Port:** `52762` (Ephemeral)
*   **Destination Host:**
    *   **IP Address:** `170.72.169.30` (Public)
    *   **MAC Address (Gateway):** `34:5d:9e:eb:0c:9b` (Sagemcom Broadband SAS)
    *   **Port:** `9000`

## Performance & Timing Analysis

A meaningful performance analysis is not possible with only a single packet. Metrics such as latency, jitter, packet loss, and throughput require a sustained conversation between hosts. No errors were detected within the captured frame.

## Application & Protocol Insights (TLS, DNS, HTTP)

- **UDP Protocol:** The packet utilizes the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
- **Port 9000:** This port is not registered for a standard IANA service. It is commonly used by various applications, including development servers (e.g., `db-lsp`, `cslistener`), custom services, and some online games.
- **No Higher-Level Protocols:** No TLS, DNS, or HTTP traffic was observed in the capture. The purpose of the communication cannot be determined without inspecting the UDP payload in a more extensive capture.

## Security Observations

The use of a non-standard port for outbound communication is not inherently a security risk, but it warrants investigation to ensure the traffic is from a legitimate and authorized application. Without further context, it is impossible to rule out unauthorized activity. The key security step is to identify the process on the source machine that generated this packet.

## Recommendations

To understand the purpose and context of this traffic, the following steps are recommended:

1.  **Identify the Source Application:** Investigate the client machine (`192.168.2.61`) to determine which application or process is sending traffic to port `9000`.
2.  **Capture a Longer Session:** A single packet provides limited insight. Capturing more traffic would reveal if the destination server responds and would show the complete communication pattern.
3.  **Check Firewall Rules:** Verify that outbound traffic to port `9000` is permitted and logged by any firewalls between the client and the internet.
4.  **Inspect Payload:** If the traffic is not encrypted, a deeper inspection of the UDP payload in a longer capture could definitively identify the application protocol.
