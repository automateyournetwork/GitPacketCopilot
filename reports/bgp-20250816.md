# Packet Analysis Report: bgp.pcap

## Executive Summary

This report documents an unsuccessful attempt to analyze the `bgp.pcap` file. The analysis could not be performed due to environmental constraints that prevented the use of the designated Packet Copilot analysis tool. The tool requires the ability to write configuration files to the local filesystem and execute shell commands, neither of which were available in the operating environment.

## Key Findings

No key findings can be reported as the network traffic analysis was not conducted.

## Conversations & Flows

No data is available on network conversations or flows.

## Performance & Timing Analysis

No data is available on performance or timing.

## Application & Protocol Insights (TLS, DNS, HTTP)

No data is available on application or protocol behavior.

## Security Observations

No security observations can be made as the packet capture file was not analyzed.

## Recommendations

To successfully analyze the `bgp.pcap` file, the Packet Copilot tool must be executed in an environment that meets the following prerequisites:

1.  **Allow Filesystem Access:** The environment must permit writing a configuration file to `~/.gemini/settings.json` to register the Packet Copilot server.
2.  **Allow Shell Command Execution:** The environment must be able to execute `npx` commands to run the `@google/gemini-cli` analysis tool.

It is recommended to re-run the analysis in a suitable environment to generate a complete and actionable report.

## Appendix

-   **Analysis Tool:** Packet Copilot (`@google/gemini-cli`)
-   **Source File:** `bgp.b64` (intended for analysis)
