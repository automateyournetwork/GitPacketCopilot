# GitPacketCopilot
Add a .pcap(ng); automated reporting; all powered by GitActions, Gemini-CLI, and Packet Copilot MCP

## How it works
Drop in a .pcap(ng) file into the `pcaps` directory. The GitActions will automatically process the file and generate a report.

### Crazy right? 
Yes it is! But it works.

Using GitActions, Gemini-CLI, and Packet Copilot MCP, this project automates the analysis of network packet captures.

#### Woah
Yes... woah indeed!
