# Packet Analysis Report: fresh_capture.pcap

## Executive Summary

This report details the analysis of the `fresh_capture.pcap` file. The capture contains a single UDP packet originating from a private network host (`192.168.2.61`) and sent to a public IP address (`170.72.169.30`). Due to the limited scope of the capture (a single packet), it is not possible to perform a comprehensive analysis of network performance, application behavior, or the full communication flow. The analysis focuses on the details available within this single frame.

## Key Findings

- **Protocol:** The traffic consists of a single User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packet.
- **Source:** The packet originated from IP `192.168.2.61` on ephemeral port `52762`. The source MAC address `c8:e2:65:48:73:b2` belongs to Intel Corporate.
- **Destination:** The packet was sent to the public IP `170.72.169.30` on port `9000`. The destination MAC address `34:5d:9e:eb:0c:9b` belongs to Sagemcom Broadband SAS, indicating a router or gateway.
- **Data Integrity:** No errors, fragmentation, or other anomalies were observed in the packet. IP and UDP checksums were unverified, which is common with checksum offloading.

## Conversations & Flows

A single, unidirectional flow was observed:

- **Source IP:** `192.168.2.61`
- **Source Port:** `52762`
- **Destination IP:** `170.72.169.30`
- **Destination Port:** `9000`
- **Protocol:** UDP

The Layer 2 conversation shows the packet moving from an Intel device to a Sagemcom device, which is typical for a host communicating through a local network gateway.

## Performance & Timing Analysis

With only one packet, it is impossible to analyze network performance metrics. Key indicators such as latency, jitter, packet loss, and throughput require a sustained bidirectional conversation to measure.

## Application & Protocol Insights (TLS, DNS, HTTP)

- **UDP/9000:** The destination port 9000 is not registered with IANA for a standard service. It is commonly used for custom applications, development servers, database listeners, or peer-to-peer services.
- **Other Protocols:** No TLS, DNS, or HTTP traffic was present in the capture.

## Security Observations

- **Unverified Checksums:** The unverified checksums are a common observation and not typically a cause for concern, as this function is often offloaded to the network interface card (NIC) to improve performance.
- **Unknown Service:** The traffic is directed to a non-standard port on a public IP address. While this may be for a legitimate application, it could also be an indicator of unauthorized or malicious communication. Further context is required to make a determination.

## Recommendations

1.  **Capture More Data:** To understand the purpose and context of this communication, a longer capture that includes the full bidirectional conversation is necessary.
2.  **Identify Source Application:** The host at `192.168.2.61` should be investigated to identify the specific application or service that is generating this UDP traffic.
3.  **Analyze Destination Service:** Further investigation into the public IP `170.72.169.30` is recommended to determine the nature of the service operating on port 9000.
