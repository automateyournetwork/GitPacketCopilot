# Packet Analysis Report: slammer.pcap

## Executive Summary

This report details the analysis of the `slammer.pcap` capture file. The capture contains a single UDP packet that is highly indicative of the **SQL Slammer worm**. The traffic represents a targeted scan or infection attempt directed at a Microsoft SQL Server, characterized by a specific packet size and destination port, which is a classic signature of this particular malware.

## Key Findings

- **Malicious Activity:** The captured packet is a SQL Slammer worm propagation attempt.
- **Attack Signature:** The traffic consists of a single UDP packet with a total IP length of 404 bytes, directed to port 1434. This is the well-known signature of the SQL Slammer worm, which exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in unpatched Microsoft SQL Server 2000 or MSDE 2000 systems.
- **Attack Source:** The host at `213.76.212.22` is the source of the attack and is likely infected with the worm.
- **Attack Target:** The host at `65.165.167.86` is the intended target of this scan and potential infection.

## Conversations & Flows

A single one-way flow was observed in this capture:

- **Source IP:** `213.76.212.22`
- **Destination IP:** `65.165.167.86`
- **Source Port:** `20199`
- **Destination Port:** `1434`
- **Protocol:** UDP
- **Source MAC:** `00:00:0c:55:46:2c` (Cisco Systems, Inc)
- **Destination MAC:** `00:00:86:55:98:1e` (Megahertz Corporation)

## Performance & Timing Analysis

Due to the capture containing only a single packet, it is not possible to perform a meaningful analysis of network performance metrics such as latency, jitter, or packet loss.

## Application & Protocol Insights (TLS, DNS, HTTP)

- **UDP/1434 (SSRP):** The destination port `1434/UDP` is used by the Microsoft SQL Server Resolution Protocol (SSRP), which is used to discover SQL Server instances on a network. The SQL Slammer worm specifically targets this service.
- **Payload Anomaly:** While the packet was dissected as `dcerpc`, this is a misinterpretation by the analysis tool. The payload is not a valid request but is a malformed one crafted to trigger a buffer overflow vulnerability in the SQL Server service.

## Security Observations

The activity in this capture is unequivocally malicious. It demonstrates a classic worm propagation technique from over two decades ago, highlighting that legacy threats can still be observed on the internet. The source host is actively scanning for vulnerable systems.

## Recommendations

1.  **Investigate Target Host:** The server at `65.165.167.86` should be investigated to determine if it is running a vulnerable version of Microsoft SQL Server and to check for any signs of compromise.
2.  **Firewall Configuration:** All inbound traffic on **UDP port 1434** should be blocked at the network perimeter unless there is a specific and documented business requirement for it to be publicly accessible.
3.  **Block Malicious Source:** The source IP address `213.76.212.22` should be added to a blocklist on firewalls and other security devices.
